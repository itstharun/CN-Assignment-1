Analysis:

While  using curl  it responds with the status code 302 meaning the requested host is found whereas using browser we obtain the status code 200 meaning request successful.
It directs to the embedded link www.vtu.ac.in/kn which is like the default page.

The request header when  accessed by the browser sends previous cookies data as well which is not done by the curl command.
 
The response while using browser contains Headers of Content-Encoding and Content-Length and Vary . Usually the Content length is obtained for the embbeded link but it is not obtained during Curl.

Security Concerns: ideally curl has all the necessary tools to spoof a browser .so  it is not possible to distinguish between a curl and browser request. Any header provided by browser can be added or modified by using curl.
