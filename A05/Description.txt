INPUT:
      format:  udpchecksum.py <Source IP Address> <Destination IP Address> <Source Port> <Destination port> <Data>

      example: udpchecksum.py  192.168.0.31  192.168.0.30  20  10 Hi

OUTPUT: The UDP Checksum obtained is: <udpchecksum>
        example output for the example given above is:
        The UDP Checksum obtained is : 0x35C5

WORKING: The program uses formatting function to convert an integer to its hexadecimal value. Addition of hexadecimal values
         is Obtained by converting respective hexadecimal to integers.

Challenges Faced:  Understanding The UDP protocol .
                   Understanding Pseudo Headers.
                   implementation of Checksum (obtaining padded hex values,wrapping carry etc.)

Note/Apology: The implementation of checksum was completely based on test cases. we tried verifying the checksum through tcpdump 
          and wireshark . The resultant checksum was always same for data transmitted and we couldnot rectify the mistake.
